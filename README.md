Building a Modern Computer From First Principles

## In this project, I have:
1. constructed a computer using elementary logic gates
2. built a game (Rodent's Revenge) using an object-oriented language (Jack)
3. built a compiler, a virtual machine, an assembler to translate the program and run it on the computer
